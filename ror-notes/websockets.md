## What is a WebSocket?
* The WebSocket API was created to allow two-way communication between a server and a client.
* A WebSocket connection keeps the http connection alive so that the server can send updates to the client without a specific request being made.

## What options did developers have before WebSockets to update a client without a user request?
## What is a consumer?
## What is a subscriber?
## What is a channel?
## What is a stream?
## How can you broadcast to a stream from the server?
