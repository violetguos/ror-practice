# Cat App with Flickr

## Api: [Flickr](https://github.com/cyclotron3k/flickr)
this ruby API out of many is still being maintained.

Overall, it's a lot of reading API docs and trying things out.

## secret key management

store the secret API keys in an environment variable instead.
I used figaro (see docs).
